# Customer Intelligence Platform: Predictive Analytics for Proactive Marketing
### _Transforming Raw Data into Revenue with a Deployed, End-to-End ML System_

As part of the Data Science and Machine Learning Certificate program at University of Toronto's Data Sciences Institute, our team selected the "Customer Purchasing Behaviors" dataset to demonstrate the technical and analytical skills developed throughout the course. 

**To be updated once steps finalized.**


## Business Case & Objectives
**The Problem:** In today's hyper-competitive retail market, businesses face the challenge of acquiring and retaining customers to drive sustainable growth in the industry. Understanding the relationship between consumer demographics, loyalty, and spending patterns is crucial to identify ideal customer profiles to develop targeted strategies. This project explores whether customer spending can be accurately predicted from key variables such as age, annual income, and geographic region.

**Objectives:** The goals of this project are to:
1.  Build a regression model to predict customer spending based on demographic and behavioural factors.
2.  Identify the most influential features that driver purchasing behaviours.
3.  Evaluate model performance through regression metrics and analysis.


## Dataset
**Source:** [Customer Purchasing Behaviors Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hanaksoy/customer-purchasing-behaviors)

**Profile:** 238 records, 7 features (`user_id`, `age`, `annual_income`, `purchase_amount`, `loyalty_score`, `region`, `purchase_frequency`).

**Data Strategy:** The dataset's simplicity is our opportunity to showcase advanced **feature engineering**. The objective is to create feature sets capturing behavioral patterns (e.g., `spend_per_purchase`, `income_to_spend_ratio`) that will be the true drivers of our model's performance. 


**Dataset Features:** 
| Feature             | Type          | Description  |
|---------------------|---------------|--------------|
| customer_id         | int64         | Unique ID of the customer      |
| age                 | int64         | The age of the customer    |
| annual_income       | int64         | The customer's annual income (in USD)     |
| purchase_amount     | int64         | The total amount of purchases made by the customer (in USD)      |
| purchase_frequency  | float64       | Frequency of customer purchases (number of times per year)    |
| region              | object        | The region where the customer lives (North, South, East, West)     |
| loyalty_score       | int64         | Customer's loyalty score (a value between 0-100)      |


**Risks and Limitations:**
While the dataset is synthetic, the methods and frameworks applied are directly applicable to real-world customer datasets, ensuring our finding remain relevant to the problem. **To update further**
